# TSP
This project is a dynamic programming solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It uses a graph represented by an adjacency matrix to compute the shortest possible tour that visits each vertex exactly once. The program outputs the optimal tour cost, the sequence of vertices in the tour, and the algorithm's execution time.
